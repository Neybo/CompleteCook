So theres some changes and general pointers i need to give so you can understand this engine:

- first things obj_door[letter] has been replaced with obj_spawnpoint and you must change
a variable definition called spawn, although stuff like obj_door and obj_hallway basically work the 
same, just targetRoom is a variable definition called t_room.

- ive tried to simplify enemies, theres a thing called do_enemy_generics() and you just gotta 
sandwich code between that and collide(), in the create event you just do event inhereted and set 
variables in the sprs struct and add states with:

states_struct.x = {x: e_states.x, func: enemy_x}.

Guide unfinished, i most likely am missing explanations.
